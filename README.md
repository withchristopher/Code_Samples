#Hydro 1D.py
Model 1D fluid flow using shock tube. Worked through code to evaluate errors and improvements.

#Matthews cipher
The matthews cipher is a chaotic function, used to encrypting information. 
The Lyapunov dimension is used to test different keys for an encrpytion alg (Matthews Cipher) for diffusion and maximum entropy (probability that every component changes with slightest change in key)

#Timing Gate - Timing_gate.py
Electronics project with a Raspberry pi computer in construction of photogate for science experiment. Output given on 2x16 character LCD screen. Device adopted by Bloodhound SSC project as official timing system for Education program.
