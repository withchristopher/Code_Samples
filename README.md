# Code_Samples
Samples of Code I have written, python, C and matlab.

#Matthews cipher
The matthews cipher is a chaotic function, used to encrypting information. 
The Lyapunov dimension is used to test different keys for an encrpytion alg (Matthews Cipher) for diffusion and maximum entropy (probability that every component changes with slightest change in key).

#Timing Gate - Timing_gate.py
Electronics project with a Raspberry pi computer in construction of photogate for science experiment. 2 x Input photo sensors via I/O pins, output given on 2x16 character LCD screen. Device adopted by Bloodhound SSC project as official timing system for Education program.
#Alpha cipher
An encryption cipher written for matlab (or SciLab), as chaotic cipher for encrpytion.
#Elo rating
Chess player rating script. Used for current chess players to input their scores and obtain a new 'Elo Rating', the official chess players rating.
